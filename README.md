# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

## Project Objective
The object of the project is to complete the supplied code, optimize the process noise parameters and demonstrate that the optimized code "accurately" predicts the system state variables.  It should be noted that this project used a CVTR model, hence, the CVTR state model was used throughout this project.

Starter code was supplied which required completion with the Unscented Kalman Filter algorithm (class UKF).  The UKF class consisted of an initialize, prediction, and update steps.  The purpose of the initialization is to initialize the model state variables with the initial measurement values.
